# Adventures with WebVR and A-Frame 

The goal of this experiment was to build a prototype with A-Frame + interactions from a smartphone. In VR a lightly lit scene is rendered with a directional light that helps understand the elements of the scene. This light is controlled using a synched smartphone (with WebRTC).
