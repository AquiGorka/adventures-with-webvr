![Light Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AquiGorka/adventures-with-webvr/master/static/light.gif)


This experiment shows a prototype with A-Frame + interactions from a smartphone. In a slightly lit VR scene a directional light helps understand and make sense of the elements in the scene. The *catch*, the light is controlled using a synced smartphone (via WebRTC).
